+Code the following app
+```
+Token Priority List — App Description
+
+Create a simple and clean mini app called “Token Priority List”.
+This app should help users organize their tokens by assigning a priority level to each of them.
+
+The app does not require internet access or external data.
+All information is entered and stored locally inside the app session.
+
+Core Features
+ 1. A text input field where the user can enter the name of a token.
+ 2. A dropdown menu with three priority options:
+ • High
+ • Medium
+ • Low
+ 3. A button “Add Token” that adds the token and its selected priority to a visible list.
+ 4. A list section that displays all added tokens in a clean table or card layout:
+ • Token name
+ • Assigned priority
+ 5. Each item in the list must have a Delete button so users can remove tokens.
+ 6. No external API requests, no web3 actions, no internet access.
+
+How the app should work
+ • The user enters a token name, selects a priority level, and presses “Add Token”.
+ • The token appears in the list with its chosen priority.
+ • The user can delete any token from the list at any time.
+ • The list updates immediately after every action.
+ • Everything works offline using only internal app state.
+
+User Interface Requirements
+ • Simple, clean layout.
+ • Inputs at the top, list below.
+ • Clear labels for every field.
+ • The app should be lightweight and responsive.
+
+Goal of the app
+
+Provide a minimal, easy-to-use tool where users can manually organize tokens by importance without requiring any external data sources.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
